            <p> Obviously the first thing you think of when you think of what you would need to go bowling is the ball.
                But it is way more than just having a ball and shoes. There are many different types of bowling balls that are made to do all sorts of
                different things. Some are made to hook earlier, some are made to hook later, some turn sharply others are more gradual.
                One of the main things that determine what a bowling ball will react like is the surface or coverstock of the ball. Just to go over the
                basics:</p> <blockquote>
                A ball with a pearl cover is more likely to get further down the lane and hooker later, a ball with a solid cover is the exact opposite
                it wants to dig as soon as it hits the lane, and lastly a hybrid is a blend of the two extremes.
        </blockquote>
            <p>A ball with a pearl cover is usually shiny and smooth to the
                touch, a ball with a solid cover is dull and rougher to the touch, and again the hybrid is between the two but will usually lean closer to one side
                or the other. If you would like to learn more about bowling equipment, please subscribe to my news
